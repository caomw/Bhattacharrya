Implements the Bhattacharrya Kernel in Python and Matlab.

"bhatta.py" contains the kernel. This is the main file
"basis.py" contains some helper functions
"bhatta_plots.py" is a utility for vizualising kernel evaluations between datasets
"mnist.py" handles loading the MNIST digit database and vectorizing it into a form the Bhattacharrya kernel can handle
"bhatta_poly" contains utilities to explicitly discover the polynomial feature space, for bugtesting the kernel and confirming correctness
"Matlab/" contains Matlab versions of the kernel; may not be correct atm
